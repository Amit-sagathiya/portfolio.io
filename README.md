- Olympic(1896-2016) power bi dashboard
  –Designed a power bi dashboard to understand the Olympic history from the year 1896 to 2016.
  –The final dashboard was effective at displaying the medals won by each player, teams, regions sorted by their age,
 olympic season(Summer/Winter), year.
  –The dashboard can help in understanding the past data using multiple filters.
  
- Laptop Price Prediction model
  Technologies Used: streamlit, python, Machine Learning models.
  –Based on the feature of the pc/laptop (ram, processor, company, weight ,screen resolution .. ) ML model predicts
 approx. price of laptop a/c to data used for train it.
